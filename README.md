### Your project 


Will be making an app to make it easier to organize a trip in one place while making it easier to find activities 
otherwise difficult to find. Including Car Rental, Stays, Activities such as tours, boat rides, atvs. Goal of this app is to make it easier for locals in tourist destinations to connect with tourists noticed on some trips that I've made that its all through some sort of middle man and is not really transparent. This would make said trips more seem less and give both the tourist and the local provider a much better experience while also providing more stable income for the provider as they are working directly with their customers.
